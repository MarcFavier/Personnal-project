# Personnal-project

Hi, here is the descritpion of a project I'm working on for some times. It's supposed to be a two legged robot. 
I have a Machine Learning Master so you can ask yourself if it is not a bit too much mechanics. I tried to diversified as much as possible my studies
to have an overall view on the robotics field. I learnt electronics, mechanics, control, automatic, visions, health and of course Machine Learning. 
I believe one need to 
It is innovative in its motorisation system. As for hydrolic systems, there is one motor providing most of the mechanical power 
with the difference than the controle and and transmission is achieved using universal joints and endless screws.
I like thos kind of systems as they provide light weight limbs (very important for fast movements), a good ratio power/weight, and allow to focuse the 
effort in the desired joint at the desired moment.
