Hi, here is the description of a project I have been working on for some time. It's supposed to be a two-legged robot.
I have a Master in Machine Learning so you might wonder if this project is not too far from my competencies and interest centers. I would answer that 
I tried to diversify my studies as much as possible to have an overview of the field of robotics. I learned electronics, mechanics, control, automation, visions, health and of course Machine Learning. Indeed I believe symbiose between all the levels of a system from its mechanical conception to its algorithms passing by its sensor is the key for high performance robots.

This project is innovative in its motorization. As with hydraulic systems, there is a motor providing most of the mechanical power
with the difference that control and transmission are carried out using universal joints and worm gears.
I like these kinds of systems because they provide light limbs (very important for fast movements), a good power-to-weight ratio, and allow you to concentrate the
effort in the desired joint at the desired time.
I tried to develop my own mechanisme as I really like research of new posssible paradigms.
